# The Impact of Early Strategic Planning on Clinical Trial Start-up and Activation Success

Effective management of clinical trial start-up and activation processes significantly affects the overall timeline and success of clinical studies. By incorporating early strategic planning during the RFI stage, companies can markedly reduce timelines, as exemplified by leaders in the industry like Ergomed. In this article, we explore how strategic planning contributes to the efficiency of clinical trials, drawing insights from real-world examples.

## Key Considerations

The start-up phase involves several critical considerations that can be optimized through strategic planning. Notably, focusing on preemptive measures to handle potential delays or bottlenecks ensures smoother processes. The following are essential components to address:

1. **Regulatory Requirements**: Assess and meet the ethics committee/IRB and regulatory authority requirements early. This includes understanding submission deadlines and feedback timelines to minimize delays.
   
2. **Site Contract and Budget Negotiations**: Early discussions around study-specific contracts and budgets enable smoother execution and agreement timelines.
   
3. **Site Equipment and Readiness**: Ensure all necessary equipment and supplies are available at the study site well before initiation to avoid unexpected delays.

4. **Site Staff Training and System Access**: Train site staff and provide necessary system access early to ensure they are ready to implement the study according to protocol.
   
5. **Investigational Product (IP) Management**: Plan for the IP's availability and shipment well in advance to ensure trials start on schedule.

6. **Site Engagement and Motivation**: Maintain high levels of site engagement by adhering to agreed timelines. Successful and timely site activation boosts motivation and commitment.
