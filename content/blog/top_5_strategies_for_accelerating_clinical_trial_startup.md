# Top 5 Strategies for Accelerating Clinical Trial Start-Up

Clinical trial start-up and activation can be complex and time-consuming, but organizations like Remington-Davis and Sitero have demonstrated that it's possible to significantly cut start-up times. With Remington-Davis achieving two-day contract execution and Sitero reducing timelines by 25%, it's vital to explore strategies that can replicate such success. Here we discuss the top five strategies for accelerating clinical trial start-up, inspired by the practices of leading companies.

## Introduction

Clinical trials are essential for bringing new medical interventions to market. However, the start-up phase often poses challenges, affecting overall timelines and costs. It's crucial to identify practices that enhance efficiency and reduce delays. This article highlights strategies for a quicker start-up process, drawing from industry leaders who have made significant strides in this area.

## Key Considerations for Clinical Trial Start-Up

To successfully accelerate clinical trial start-up, it's important to consider regulatory requirements, study logistics, and stakeholder coordination. Streamlining site selection and activation, as well as employing technology solutions, can also be significant factors in reducing timeline inefficiencies.

## Top 5 Strategies for Accelerating Start-Up:

1. **Streamlined Contract and Site Activation:**
   - Companies like [Remington-Davis](/dir/remington-davis) have exemplified efficiency with two-day contract execution. Quick site activation is achievable with well-coordinated site readiness strategies and streamlined processes.

2. **Technology Utilization:**
   - Utilizing a clinical trial management system (CTMS), such as those by [ITHS CTMS Program Office](/dir/iths_ctms_program_office), can track regulatory approvals and enhance study start-up management, keeping activities on schedule.

3. **Data-Driven Decision Making:**
   - By maintaining comprehensive databases and employing predictive analytics, as supported by [InfoEd Global](/dir/infoed_global), organizations can make informed decisions, optimizing site selection and enrollment strategies.
